Welcome to the Employee Management System project repository! This project is a comprehensive solution for managing employee information within an organization. It features a user-friendly interface and leverages modern web technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and a mock API for the backend.

## Project Overview

The Employee Management System allows administrators to view, add, update, and delete employee information. The application is built with a responsive design to ensure it works seamlessly across different devices.

## Features

- **Employee List**: View a list of all employees with details such as name, position, and department.
- **Add Employee**: Add new employees to the system.
- **Edit Employee**: Update existing employee information.
- **Delete Employee**: Remove employees from the system.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures a consistent experience across various devices.

## Folder Structure

- **index.html**: The main HTML file for the employee list page.
- **add_employee.html**: The HTML file for adding new employees.
- **edit_employee.html**: The HTML file for editing existing employee information.
- **style.css**: The CSS file containing styles for the entire application.

## How It Works

1. **Employee List**: The homepage displays a list of all employees fetched from the mock API. Each employee entry has options to edit or delete the employee.

2. **Add Employee**: The add employee page allows administrators to enter details for a new employee and submit the form to add them to the system.

3. **Edit Employee**: The edit employee page allows administrators to update the details of an existing employee. The information is fetched from the mock API and updated upon form submission.
